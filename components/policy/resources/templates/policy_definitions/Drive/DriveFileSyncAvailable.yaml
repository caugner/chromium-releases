  <ph name="GOOGLE_DRIVE_NAME">Google Drive</ph> file sync automatically makes
  files in a user's My drive available offline (space permitting) on supported
  devices. After initially making all files available offline, all new files
  will also be made available offline automatically. Once the feature is on, if
  later there is insufficient space to keep the feature on, all new files will
  stop being automatically made available offline, however, a user can still
  manually toggle items.

  Setting the policy to <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_VISIBLE">visible</ph> shows the
  file sync functionality in the Files app and in the Settings page. Users are
  still required to toggle the file sync functionality on themselves.

  Setting the policy to <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_DISABLED">disabled</ph> will turn
  off the file sync functionality if previously turned on by the user and will
  also hide the feature from Files app and Settings so the user canâ€™t re-enable
  it. If there are any existing files that were made available offline by the
  user, they will remain available offline and the user can manually make
  individual files available offline (they will not be automatically made
  available offline).

  If the policy is unset, it will use
  <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_VISIBLE">visible</ph> as the default value.
