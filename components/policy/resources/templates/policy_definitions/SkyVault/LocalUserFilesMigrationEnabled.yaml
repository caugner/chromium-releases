caption: Enable local user files migration to the cloud storage
desc: |-
  Triggers migration of existing local files to the cloud.
  Applies only for SkyVault users, i.e. when LocalUserFilesAllowed is false
  and DownloadDirectory is either Google Drive or OneDrive, and is ignored otherwise.
      If True, local files are moved to the cloud and local folders then hidden from the user.
      If False or unset, local files remain in read-only mode.
