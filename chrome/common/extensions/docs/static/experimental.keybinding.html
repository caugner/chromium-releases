<p>
The keybinding API allows you to add keyboard shortcuts that trigger actions in
your extension. An action can be opening the browser action or page action popup
or sending a command to the extension.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>
<p>
In addition to the "experimental" permission you must declare the "keybinding"
permission in your extension's manifest to use this API.
</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
<b>  "permissions": [
    "experimental",
    "keybinding",
  ]</b>,
  ...
}</pre>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The keybinding API allows you to define specific commands, and bind them to a
default key combination. Each command your extension accepts must be listed in
the manifest as an attribute of the 'commands' manifest key. Note: Combinations
that involve Ctrl+Alt are not permitted in order to avoid conflicts with the
AltGr key.</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
<b>  "commands": {
    "toggle-feature-foo": {
      "key": "Ctrl+Shift+Y",
      "description": "Toggle feature foo"
    },
    "browserAction": {
      "key": "Ctrl+Shift+B"
    },
    "pageAction": {
      "key": "Alt+P"
    }

  }</b>,
  ...
}</pre>

<p>In your background page, you can bind a handler to each of the commands
defined in the manifest (except for 'browserAction' and 'pageAction') via
onCommand.addListener. For example:</p>

<pre>
chrome.experimental.keybinding.onCommand.addListener(function(command) {
  console.log('Command:', command);
});
</pre>

<p>The 'browserAction' and 'pageAction' commands are reserved for the action of
opening your extension's popups. They won't normally generate events that you
can handle. If you need to take action based on your popup opening, consider
listening for an 'onDomReady' event inside your popup's code.
