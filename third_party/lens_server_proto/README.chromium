Description:
This package contains the protos that are used by the Lens team to facilitate
integration between Chrome and Google Search.
Updates to this code should be made by changing the internal copies, and then
running the export script.

blaze run //lens/chrome/scripts/proto_export -- \
  --from_piper \
  --output=$CHROMIUM_SRC/third_party/lens_server_proto


Local Modifications:
The export script uses a library that migrates our protos to use editions.
However, this is not currently supported by the proto lite runtime that is being
used by Chrome. Thus, we need to make local modifications to remove these
changes to prevent a failing build. See https://protobuf.dev/editions/overview/
for more info.
