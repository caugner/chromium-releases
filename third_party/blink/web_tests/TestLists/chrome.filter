# This file lists WPTs that should run against chrome via chromedriver. Tests
# should run in this configuration if they depend on the `//chrome` layer.
# Otherwise, the test should be listed in `TestLists/headless_shell.filter`,
# since headless shell is generally faster. Chromedriver tests should not be
# listed in either of the files as they are handled separately.
